# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Feature Mapping Pipeline addresses a fundamental architectural challenge in the FraudGuard system: bridging the gap between academic rigor and practical usability. Currently, the system suffers from a critical flaw where it discards 93% of predictive information by only utilizing 2 features (Time, Amount) while the ULB dataset's true predictive power lies in the 28 PCA-transformed features (V1-V28). This creates an impossible user experience dilemma where academic requirements demand all 30 features for proper model performance, but users cannot realistically input cryptic PCA values.

The Intelligent Feature Mapping Pipeline implements a dual-layer architecture that maintains academic integrity while solving the practical deployment challenge. Layer 1 collects 5 user-friendly, interpretable features from users, while Layer 2 automatically transforms these inputs into the complete 30-feature vector required by the academically-trained fraud detection models. This approach enables the system to leverage the full predictive power of the ULB dataset while presenting users with intuitive, human-understandable inputs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fraud analyst, I want to input transaction details using business-meaningful terms instead of cryptic PCA values, so that I can efficiently assess fraud risk without requiring deep technical knowledge of the underlying model features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the fraud detection interface THEN the system SHALL present 5 intuitive input fields: Transaction Amount, Merchant Category, Transaction Time Context, Location Risk Level, and Spending Pattern Deviation
2. WHEN a user selects a merchant category THEN the system SHALL provide predefined options including grocery, gas station, online retail, restaurant, ATM withdrawal, and other common transaction types
3. WHEN a user inputs transaction time context THEN the system SHALL accept hour of day and day of week information and automatically calculate risk factors based on typical spending patterns
4. WHEN a user specifies location risk level THEN the system SHALL accept categorical inputs (normal location, slightly unusual, highly unusual, foreign country) rather than requiring precise geographic coordinates
5. WHEN a user indicates spending pattern deviation THEN the system SHALL accept descriptive levels (typical amount, slightly higher, much higher than usual, suspicious amount) instead of statistical calculations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the feature mapping system to automatically transform user-friendly inputs into the complete 30-feature vector required by our trained models, so that we maintain the academic rigor and performance of models trained on the full ULB dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives 5 user-friendly inputs THEN it SHALL generate estimates for all 28 PCA-transformed features (V1-V28) using statistical mapping techniques
2. WHEN generating PCA feature estimates THEN the system SHALL use multi-output regression models trained on the correlation patterns between interpretable features and PCA components in the ULB dataset
3. WHEN creating the complete feature vector THEN the system SHALL combine the original Time and Amount values with the 28 estimated V1-V28 values to produce a 30-feature input compatible with existing trained models
4. WHEN the mapping process completes THEN the system SHALL validate that the generated feature vector falls within reasonable bounds based on the ULB dataset distribution
5. WHEN feature mapping fails or produces invalid results THEN the system SHALL fall back to a conservative estimation approach using dataset averages and log appropriate warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the feature mapping pipeline to maintain high performance and reliability, so that fraud detection remains fast and accurate for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a single transaction THEN the feature mapping pipeline SHALL complete the transformation from 5 inputs to 30 features within 10 milliseconds
2. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN the feature mapping SHALL maintain sub-50ms response times for 95% of requests
3. WHEN mapping models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to a simplified mapping approach rather than failing completely
4. WHEN feature mapping encounters invalid inputs THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which inputs need correction
5. WHEN the pipeline processes requests THEN it SHALL log performance metrics and mapping quality indicators for monitoring and optimization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fraud detection model, I want to receive feature vectors that preserve the statistical properties and predictive relationships of the original ULB dataset, so that my accuracy and performance remain consistent with academic benchmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mapping system generates V1-V28 estimates THEN the resulting feature distributions SHALL maintain correlation patterns consistent with the original ULB dataset within 15% variance
2. WHEN mapped features are used for fraud prediction THEN the model performance SHALL achieve at least 95% of the accuracy obtained when using actual ULB dataset features
3. WHEN generating feature estimates THEN the system SHALL preserve the relative importance rankings of features as determined by SHAP analysis of the original dataset
4. WHEN creating PCA component estimates THEN the system SHALL ensure that the generated values maintain the orthogonality properties expected by models trained on actual PCA components
5. WHEN validating mapping quality THEN the system SHALL compare predicted fraud probabilities using mapped features against a validation set of actual ULB transactions with known outcomes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the feature mapping system to provide explainable transformations and maintain audit trails, so that I can understand and document how user inputs are converted to model predictions for regulatory purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a feature mapping is performed THEN the system SHALL generate an explanation showing how each user input contributed to the estimated PCA feature values
2. WHEN providing mapping explanations THEN the system SHALL use SHAP values to show the relative importance of each user input in determining the final fraud prediction
3. WHEN storing mapping results THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit log including original user inputs, generated feature vectors, mapping model versions, and timestamps
4. WHEN a mapping explanation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide both technical details for data scientists and business-friendly summaries for non-technical stakeholders
5. WHEN regulatory compliance requires documentation THEN the system SHALL export mapping explanations and audit trails in standard formats (JSON, CSV, PDF reports)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want the feature mapping models to be trainable and updatable, so that I can improve mapping accuracy as we gather more data and refine our understanding of feature relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training mapping models THEN the system SHALL support multiple regression techniques including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network approaches for estimating PCA components
2. WHEN new training data becomes available THEN the system SHALL provide functionality to retrain mapping models and validate improvement in mapping quality
3. WHEN deploying updated mapping models THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing to compare new mapping approaches against existing ones
4. WHEN evaluating mapping model performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics including mean squared error for each PCA component, correlation preservation, and downstream fraud detection accuracy
5. WHEN managing model versions THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and allow rollback to previous mapping model versions if performance degrades

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the system to provide intelligent defaults and suggestions for input fields, so that I can quickly assess transactions without extensive manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user begins entering transaction details THEN the system SHALL suggest merchant categories based on transaction amount patterns and common business types
2. WHEN time context is being entered THEN the system SHALL automatically populate current time information and highlight if the transaction time represents unusual activity patterns
3. WHEN location risk is being assessed THEN the system SHALL provide contextual guidance about what constitutes normal vs. suspicious location patterns
4. WHEN spending pattern deviation is being evaluated THEN the system SHALL offer examples and benchmarks to help users categorize the transaction appropriately
5. WHEN all inputs are provided THEN the system SHALL display a confidence indicator showing how reliable the feature mapping is likely to be based on input quality and completeness
